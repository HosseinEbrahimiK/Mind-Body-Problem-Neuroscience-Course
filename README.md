# Neuroscience-Course
These are multiple projects I had worked on during Foundations of Neuroscience course.

## Telepathy Experiment
My results for an experiment we designed in order to check whether telepathy exists among close people, which is an important question to think about as it can play a huge role in the mind-body debate, the famous controversial topic in neuroscience. The report is available in the manuscript. 

## Analysis of Visual Features for Cortical Complex Cells
This project was about characterization of feature representation of complex neurons, which have complex nonlinear response properties. This is based on a paper called Isolation of Relevant Visual Features from Random Stimuli for Cortical Complex Cells by Touryan et al.

## Presentation about taste 
My lecture about "Functional specificity in the human brain: A window into the functional architecture of the mind" by N. Kanwisher.
